### Demo Script for Scenario 1

**Opening (0:00-0:30)**:
"Welcome to our live Industrial Control System cybersecurity demonstration. You're looking at a real water treatment plant running on actual PLC hardware. This isn't a simulation - these are genuine industrial protocols controlling real processes that could exist in any city's infrastructure.

Currently, you can see normal operations: pumps are cycling based on water levels, valves are adjusting flow rates, and all safety systems are active. Our AI system has learned these baseline patterns over the past hour and established what 'normal' looks like for this specific plant."

**Attack Launch (0:30-1:30)**:
"Now I'm launching a real cyberattack from this Kali Linux system. Watch the network traffic spike as the attacker performs reconnaissance, discovers our Modbus devices, and begins unauthorized commands. You can see pump states changing unexpectedly - this would cause real operational disruption."

**Detection and Response (2:00-2:30)**:
"Here's where our system shines. Without any human intervention, our AI detected the anomalous patterns, correlated the attack across multiple data sources, and is now automatically implementing countermeasures. The attacking IP is being blocked, suspicious commands are being filtered, and the process is being restored to safe operation."

**Recovery (2:30-3:00)**:
"The attack is neutralized, normal operations are restored, and most importantly - our system has learned from this attack. It's now better prepared for similar threats, including variants it's never seen before. All of this happened in under 30 seconds with zero human intervention."

### Demo Script for Scenario 2

**Opening (0:00-0:20)**:
"Now we'll demonstrate our insider threat detection capabilities. This operator has legitimate access to the system, but watch how our behavioral analysis detects when they begin acting suspiciously."

**Suspicious Behavior (0:20-0:40)**:
"Notice how the operator is now accessing areas they don't normally use, downloading configuration files, and attempting administrative functions. Our AI has learned this operator's normal behavior patterns and is detecting these anomalies."

**Response (1:00-1:20)**:
"The system has automatically triggered additional authentication requirements and restricted access privileges. This is all happening without any human intervention - our behavioral analysis engine is protecting the system from insider threats."

**Detection (0:30-1:00)**:
"Even though this is a zero-day attack, our behavioral analysis has detected the anomalous patterns. The system doesn't need to recognize the specific attack - it recognizes that the behavior is abnormal and potentially malicious."

**Response (1:00-1:30)**:
"Without any prior knowledge of this attack type, our system is implementing adaptive countermeasures based on behavioral analysis. It's learning and responding in real-time."

**Evolution (1:30-2:00)**:
"The attack has been neutralized, and our system has learned from this encounter. It's now better prepared for similar threats in the future. This demonstrates true adaptive cybersecurity."
