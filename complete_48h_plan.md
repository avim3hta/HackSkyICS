## Live Demo Script

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Welcome to our live Industrial Control System cybersecurity demonstration. You're looking at a real water treatment plant running on actual PLC hardware. This isn't a simulation - these are genuine industrial protocols controlling real processes that could exist in any city's infrastructure."

### **Normal Operations (60 seconds)**
"Currently, you can see normal operations: pumps are cycling based on water levels, valves are adjusting flow rates, and all safety systems are active. Our AI system has learned these baseline patterns over the past hour and established what 'normal' looks like for this specific plant."

### **Attack Launch (90 seconds)**
"Now I'm launching a real cyberattack from this Kali Linux system. Watch the network traffic spike as the attacker performs reconnaissance, discovers our Modbus devices, and begins unauthorized commands. You can see pump states changing unexpectedly - this would cause real operational disruption."

### **Autonomous Detection (60 seconds)**
"Here's where our system shines. Without any human intervention, our AI detected the anomalous patterns, correlated the attack across multiple data sources, and is now automatically implementing countermeasures. The attacking IP is being blocked, suspicious commands are being filtered, and the process is being restored to safe operation."

### **Recovery & Evolution (30 seconds)**
"The attack is neutralized, normal operations are restored, and most importantly - our system has learned from this attack. It's now better prepared for similar threats, including variants it's never seen before. All of this happened in under 30 seconds with zero human intervention."
