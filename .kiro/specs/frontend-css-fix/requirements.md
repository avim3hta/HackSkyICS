# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is experiencing CSS configuration issues with Tailwind CSS v4, specifically with custom CSS variables and utility classes like `border-border` not being recognized. The system needs a properly configured Tailwind CSS setup that works with the existing shadcn-ui components and custom color scheme.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Tailwind CSS configuration to work properly with all custom utility classes, so that the frontend application can render without CSS errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN all Tailwind CSS utility classes SHALL be recognized and applied correctly
2. WHEN custom color variables like `border-border` are used THEN they SHALL render properly without errors
3. WHEN shadcn-ui components are rendered THEN their styling SHALL display correctly with all CSS variables defined

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS variables for the design system to be properly defined, so that the color scheme and theming work consistently across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS variables are referenced in Tailwind classes THEN they SHALL be properly defined in the CSS file
2. WHEN dark mode is toggled THEN all color variables SHALL update appropriately
3. WHEN custom colors like success, warning, sidebar colors are used THEN they SHALL render with correct values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PostCSS configuration to be compatible with Tailwind CSS v4, so that the build process works without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN PostCSS SHALL process Tailwind CSS without plugin errors
2. WHEN the development server starts THEN hot module replacement SHALL work correctly with CSS changes
3. WHEN CSS files are imported THEN they SHALL be processed correctly by the build system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing component styles to continue working, so that no visual regressions occur during the CSS fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing components are rendered THEN their visual appearance SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN responsive breakpoints are used THEN they SHALL continue to work as expected
3. WHEN animations and transitions are applied THEN they SHALL function correctly
