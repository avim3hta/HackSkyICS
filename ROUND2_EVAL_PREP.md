## üöÄ **Pre-Demo Checklist (15 minutes)**

### **Technical Preparation:**
- [ ] Frontend running on http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Backend running (if needed for full features)
- [ ] All major routes working (/, /admin, /anomaly)
- [ ] ML anomaly detection streaming works
- [ ] Charts and visualizations loading
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### **Demo Preparation:**
- [ ] Browser window cleaned up (close other tabs)
- [ ] Zoom level appropriate for audience
- [ ] Have backup tab ready in case of issues
- [ ] Practice the 5-minute flow at least once
- [ ] Prepare for potential questions

### **Questions You Might Get:**

#### **Technical Questions:**
- **"How does the ML model work?"**
  - *"We use a deep autoencoder neural network trained on 950,000 industrial sensor readings. It learns normal patterns and flags anomalies based on reconstruction error."*

- **"Is this just a demo or production-ready?"**
  - *"The architecture is production-ready. We have trained models, real-time data processing, and scalable cloud infrastructure. The next phase would involve actual PLC integration."*

- **"What makes this different from existing solutions?"**
  - *"Most ICS security is rule-based. We use AI to detect unknown attack patterns and respond autonomously without human intervention."*

#### **Business Questions:**
- **"How would this deploy in real environments?"**
  - *"Our modular architecture allows incremental deployment. Start with monitoring, add response capabilities, then expand to multiple facilities."*

- **"What's the performance impact?"**
  - *"Less than 5% system overhead with sub-second response times. The ML runs on dedicated hardware separate from control systems."*
